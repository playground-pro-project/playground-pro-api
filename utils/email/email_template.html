        <p>
            Thank you for choosing our platform. We are committed to ensuring
            the security of your account and protecting your valuable
            information. As part of our ongoing efforts to strengthen account
            security, we have implemented a One-Time Password (OTP) verification
            process.
        </p>

        <p>
            To complete the registration/verification process, please use the
            following OTP code:
        </p>

        <p>OTP:</p>
        <h1>{{.OTP}}</h1>

        <p>
            Please note that this OTP is valid for a limited time period and
            should not be shared with anyone. It serves as a one-time
            verification code to authenticate your account.
        </p>

        <p>
            Thank you for your cooperation. We appreciate your trust in our
